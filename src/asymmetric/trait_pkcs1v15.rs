    /// Encrypts the data with the padding defined
    /// according to PKCS #1 ver. 1.5.
    /// 
    /// # Arguments
    /// - `message` is an immutable pointer to `u8` which is `*const u8`,
    ///   and is the place where the plaintext to be encrypted is stored.
    /// - `length_in_bytes` is of `u64`-type,
    ///   and is the length of the plaintext `message` in bytes.
    /// - `cipher` is a mutable pointer to `u8` which is `*mut u8`, and
    ///   is the place where the encrypted data will be stored.
    /// 
    /// # Output
    /// - This method returns the size of ciphertext including padding bits
    ///   in bytes.
    /// - If this method succeeds in encryption, the output will be
    ///   `size_of::<T>() * N`.
    /// - If this method failed in encryption, this method returns `zero`.
/*  /// 
    /// # Features
    /// - You are not encouraged to use this method in pure Rust programming.
    ///   Instead, use other safer methods such as `encrypt_*_into_*()`.
    /// - This method is useful to use in hybrid programming with C/C++.
    /// - If `length_in_bytes` is `0`, it means the message is null string.
    ///   So, only padding bytes will be encrypted,
    ///   and stored in the memory area that starts from `cipher`.
    /// - The size of the memory area which starts at `cipher` is assumed to be
    ///   enough to store the ciphertext.
    /// - The size of the area for ciphertext should be prepared to be
    ///   (`length_in_bytes` + `1`).next_multiple_of(`size_of::<T>()`) at least.
    ///   So, it is responsible for you to prepare the `cipher` area big enough!
    /// - The padding bits are composed of the bytes that indicate the length of
    ///   the padding bits in bytes according to PKCS #7 defined in RFC 5652.
    /// - For more information about the padding bits according to PKCS #7,
    ///   Read [here](https://node-security.com/posts/cryptography-pkcs-7-padding/).
    /// 
    /// # For Rijndael or AES, and its variants
    /// ## Example 1 for AES-128
